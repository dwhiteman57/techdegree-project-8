# Techdegree Project 8: SQL Library Manager

This is my unit-8 project for the full stack techdegree. This project focused on building a node.js application utilizing Express, Pug and Sequelize ORM. The application is a mock libarary manger that performs all CRUD functionality, communicating with an sqlite database via Sequelize ORM.

The project also makes use of Sequelize Validation methods including custom error messages for the user. The app performs all error validation including blank fields and returns friendly error messages for 404 and 500 errors.

## Respource List

I relied on a few resources for help in finishing this project. Those include:
- Sequelize ORM With Express course by Guil Hernandez: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/using-sequelize-orm-with-express
- Creating table arrays in PUG: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7921556/how-to-create-an-html-table-with-jade-iterating-an-array
- Displaying URL inside table td: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46202398/displaying-url-inside-table-td-pug-jade-currently-only-displaying-as-text
